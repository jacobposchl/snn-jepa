# list of things to work on:

## immediate:
1. validate latent representations across time (ensure doesn't collapse through training)
2. implement VIC regularization
3. can JEPA learn something meaningful? (behavior?)
4. implement SNN to align to latent representations

## future:
1. compare active vs. passive blocks within the same session
    - does the manifold shift? How? Gain, Rotation, Inclusion? does the SNN generalize? 


## longterm:
1. Scale across multiple sessions
